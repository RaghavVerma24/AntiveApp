              as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile
              application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto
              (collectively, the "Site"). We are registered in Canada and have
              our registered office at Virtual, Mississauga, Ontario. You agree
              that by accessing the Site, you have read, understood, and agreed
              to be bound by all of these Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH
              ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM
              USING THE SITE AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY
            </p>

            <p>
              Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted
              on the Site from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated
              herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion,
              to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Use from time
              to time. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last
              updated" date of these Terms of Use and you waive any right to
              receive specific notice of each such change. Please ensure that
              you check the applicable Terms every time you use our Site so that
              you understand which Terms apply. You will be subject to, and will
              be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the
              changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of the

              distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction
              or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law
              or regulation or which would subject us to any registration
              requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly,
              those persons who choose to access the Site from other locations
              do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for
              compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are
              applicable.

              (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA),
              etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws,
              you may not use this Site. You may not use the site in a way that
              would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). All users who are

              the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly

              are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree
              to these Terms of Use prior to you using the Site.

            <h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by
              us on the Site or in respect to the Site constitute the entire
              agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
              exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use
              shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These
              Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We
              may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at
              any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss,
              damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our
              reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of
              these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful, void, or
              unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed
              severable from these Terms of Use and does not affect the validity
              and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint
              venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created
              between you and us as a result of these Terms of Use or use of the
              Site. You agree that these Terms of Use will not be construed
              against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any
              and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of
              these Terms of Use and the lack of signing by the parties hereto
              to execute these Terms of Use.
